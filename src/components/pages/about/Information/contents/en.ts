      'Yusril is a technologist, webmaster, virtual assistant, inspiring designer, and educator based in Indonesia. His tech journey began when he joined VHS Telkom Malang, driven by his accumulated interest in technology from an early age, starting with a cellphone introduced by his parents.',
      'Java was his first exposure to programming, followed by PHP as his introduction to web development, and he currently resides in the JS world. His background in JS started as a backend developer, creating endpoints and connecting them to databases such as MySQL and MongoDB. The transition to frontend development happened during his final VHS project when he became a full-stack developer, handling both backend and frontend development while working on Laporkeun.',
      'His frontend development journey elevated to a professional setting in 2021 when he landed a role as a frontend developer at an Indonesian telecommunications startup in the agriculture sector. There, he met professionals and learned about teamwork, product development, best practices in software development, and Next.js. CI/CD and code reviews also became part of his journey in software development, responsibilities entrusted to him after one year of contributing to the project.',
      "Today, Yusril continues his education by enrolling in Binus University Online, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems. His studies cover a range of topics from business to the product development cycle, with a current focus on User Experience. Meanwhile, he continues to dive deeper into the world of frontend development in a more visual style, learning and creating web animations and motion graphic designs.",
